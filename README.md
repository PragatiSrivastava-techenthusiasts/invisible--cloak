HARRY POTTER INVISIBILITY CLOAK::
This project is inspired by Harry Potter’s legendary invisibility cloak. Using Python and OpenCV, it creates a visual illusion where the person wearing a specific-colored cloth (usually red/blue/green) appears to vanish, blending seamlessly with the background.

The project works by:

Capturing the background using the webcam (background.py).

Detecting the cloak’s color in the video stream using color detection and masking.

Replacing that region with the background, giving the illusion that the cloak (and what it covers) is invisible (invisible_cloak.py).

✨ In short, it’s a fun computer vision project that demonstrates how image processing and masking can be combined to mimic Harry Potter’s invisibility cloak.
